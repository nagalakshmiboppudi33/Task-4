Project Title :
  Transport Analytics System 
    (Flue efficiency,Route costing & Delay details)
Object :
  The aim of the project is to analyse transport analytics pipeline that takes the multiple data sources and performs data engineering and analysis , and presents visualizations using power BI and make dashboards and analytiics reports.
This Project Targets on :
   --> Data Collection & Integration
   --> Data Engineering
   --> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   --> Route cost & Fuel efficiency analysis
   --> Reporting & Dashboards
Tools :
    Python & libraries :
         .pandas
         .matplotlib
         .seaborn
    Environment : 
         .VSCode
         .Power BI
    Version Control :
         Git & GitHub
--> Data Collection & Integration :
      In this i have taken the different datasets such as Vehicle details, Driver logs, GPS route logs, Fuel consumption logs, Driver logs, Maintenance history
    Data Cleaning : 
      . Hadling Missing Values:these are handleded using the mean replacement and forward filling.
      . Data Type Correction and these data sets are used for the futher steps.
--> Data Engineering :
      In this data engineering all 6 datasets are merged into a single Unified Master Analytical Dataset.
      This master dataset used for analyis and dashboards.
--> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
      EDA is for performing and the understanding the whole dataset using the visuals .
      And this visuals are depends on the Fuel efficiency trends per vehicle ,Driver-wise performance score, most expensive routes, most delay-prone routes,predictive factors for high fuel consumption and etc.
--> Route cost & fuel efficiency analysis :
      This are the analysis prepared using the route columns and total trip cost ,and fuel efficiency column,are used for the Route cost and fuel efficiency analysis using the visual charts.
--> Reporting & Dashboards :
      Reports and Dashboards are prepared on the "POWER BI DESKTOP".
      .In this datasets are loaded .
      .Write queries and save the queries.
      .Then make visuals using different charts like
        column chart,slicers,bar charts,tables,funnels etc.
Steps To Run The Project :
   --> Step-1 : Install pythonn latest version, and install libraries pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib using pip install command.
   --> Step-2 : For the datasets run the command 
        command :Transport_Analytics_System.py
        output in :Driver_logs.csv ,Fuel_logs.csv,  Gps_routes_logs.csv,Maintenance_history.csv,Vehicle_details.csv,Delivery_timelines.csv.
    --> Step-3 : And the data cleaning ,data egineering,EDA,route cost & fuel efficiency analysis codes are in Transport_Analytics.ipynb
    --> Step-4 : Reports And Dashboards are done in Power BI Desktop.
